## Investigating Supervised Machine Learning Methods to Understand Factors that Affects Number of Shares of Blog Posts
With the growing number of media content creators, it has become increasingly important to understand the factors that contribute to the success of posts in order to stand out. Predicting the number of times that articles are shared is useful as it enables them to understand their audience better and tailor content to meet their preferences. This is especially important as many content creators generate revenue through advertising or affiliate marketing. Thus, accurately predicting the number of views for blog articles can provide valuable insights and help content creators achieve their goals.
